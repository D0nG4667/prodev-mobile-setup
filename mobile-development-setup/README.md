# 📱 0. Setting Up and Testing Your Mobile Development Environment  

## Mandatory Task

Mobile development requires more computational resources than traditional web development. To ensure a smooth and efficient workflow, this project uses the **Expo Framework** for React Native — a powerful toolchain that simplifies building, testing, and deploying mobile applications.

This setup ensures you are fully prepared for the upcoming mobile development projects.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Set up and test your mobile development environment by installing **Expo Go** on your physical device. This allows you to run and preview React Native applications without needing heavy emulators or expensive hardware.

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure the following are already installed on your system:

- **Node.js LTS**  
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**  
- **macOS, Linux, or Windows**  
- **A physical Android or iOS device**

These tools form the foundation of your mobile development workflow.

## 🤔 Why Expo Go?

Mobile development typically requires device emulators, which can be resource‑intensive and hardware‑dependent. With the rapid evolution of mobile devices (e.g., iPhone 7 → iPhone 16 Pro Max, and countless Android models), maintaining emulators becomes costly and inefficient.

**Expo Go solves this problem** by allowing you to:

- Run React Native apps directly on your physical device  
- Avoid emulator setup entirely  
- Test instantly via QR code  
- Use the same workflow on both Android and iOS  

This makes Expo Go a lightweight, cost‑effective, and developer‑friendly solution.
